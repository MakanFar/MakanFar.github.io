    ### Hi, I‚Äôm Makan

    I am a PhD student in computer science at [University of California-Davis](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=uc+davis&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). My research is focused mainly on understanding ML and integrating AI in domain- specific applications including but not limited to computer vision and natural language processing. 

    I was born in Iran, and I did my undergraduate degree in Istanbul, Turkey where I also gained 2 years of well-rounded experience in software development. In last years of my undergraduate degree I started working as a research assistant and conducted research on Transformers in medical image segmentation, detection, and classification. 

    Currently, I am working in the [DIB lab](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/) under the supervision of [Dr. C.Titus Brown](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O4rYanMAAAAJ). I work on development and maintenance of Khmer, sourmash, and spacegraphcats, software for faster and more efficient 
    sequence analysis of high-throughput sequencing data. I am also a member of [AI in Veterinary Medicine research group](https://ai.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/), and I conduct research on multi-modal data fusion models for healthcare applications, new computer vision and natural language processing approaches for healthcare specific domains.

    There are quite a few things I am passionate about in life, and my research is just one facet of my life. 
    I also enjoy camping in nature üèïÔ∏è combined with a hike and a campfire.
