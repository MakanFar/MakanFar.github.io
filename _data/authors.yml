    Hi welcome to my website! My name is Makan (MA - KAN) and I am a first year PhD student in CS. To give a bit of background, 
    I am originally from Iran but I have received my bachelors in Software Engineering from IAU in Istanbul, Turkey,  where 
    I also gained 2 years of well-rounded experience in software development. In the last years of my undergraduate degree I 
    started doing research on applied AI and computer vision as a research assistant which made me to fall in love with AI and ML. 
    
    Currently, I am studying PhD in Computer Science at University of California-Davis under the supervision of Dr. C.Titus Brown. 
    I mostly conduct research on AI enabled solutions such as computer vision, and ML for Veterinary medicine and healthcare. I also 
    work on development and maintenance of sourmash, and spacegraphcats, which are softwares for faster and more efficient sequence analysis of high-throughput sequencing data.
