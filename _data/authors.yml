    ### Hi, Iâ€™m Makan

    I am a first year PhD student in computer science at [University of California-Davis](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=uc+davis&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). My research is focused mainly on AI, ML, and their applications in veterinary medicine and healthcare.

    To give a bit of background, I am originally from Iran but I have received my bachelors in Software Engineering from IAU in Istanbul, Turkey,  where I also gained 2 years of well-rounded experience in software development. In last years of my undergraduate degree I started working as a research assistant and conducted research on applied AI and computer vision. 

    Currently, I am working in the [DIB lab](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/) under the supervision of [Dr. C.Titus Brown](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O4rYanMAAAAJ), where I mostly conduct research on AI enabled solutions such as computer vision, and ML for Veterinary medicine and healthcare. I also work on development and maintenance of Khmer, sourmash, and spacegraphcats, which are softwares for faster and more efficient sequence analysis of high-throughput sequencing data.
