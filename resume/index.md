## **Employment**

`2022- Current` **Research Assitant**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _University of California-Davis_

: > Working at the [Data Intensive Biology Lab](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/) and a member of [AI in Veterinary Medicine](https://ai.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/) research group. I conduct research on AI enabled solutions such as computer vision, and ML for Veterinary medicine and work on development and maintenance of sourmash, and spacegraphcats, which are softwares for faster and more efficient sequence analysis of high-throughput sequencing data.


`May 2022- Sep 2022` **Mid Developer**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _Dtech Software (Istanbul, Turkey)_

: > Developed and maintained customer communication management (CCM) systems for Banks and
insurance companies (MetLife, Dubai Islamic Bank, RakBank, and etc..) using Quadient
interactive designer.

: > Created data transformer modules and pipelines for customer data and transactions for
both static and real-time reporting.



`Sep 2020- Apr 2021` **Junior Developer**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _Vista Medikal (Istanbul, Turkey)_

: > Web development using Redux and React, and developed CRM system using Django for medical sales representatives.



`Jul 2020- Oct 2020` **Intern**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _Entekhab Group (Tehran, Iran)_

: > Worked on embedded systems with IoT applications using MCU, and C# programming.



## **Research Projects**


`Aug 2022` **Deep Learning for early diagnosis of Covid-19 infection based on CXRs.**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _ (In Submission) Advisor: Prof. Dr. ALİ OKATAN_

: > In this work, the performance of a new depth-wise convolution neural networks model with self-attention layers on diagnosis of medical cases using CXRs is accessed. Images of chest x-rays from patients with confirmed Covid-19, pulmonary opacity, and normal cases, were used for automatic detection with the suggested model. The purposed model was trained to provide a diagnosis for multi-label classification of all three cases (Covid-19, lung opacity, normal). The best accuracy obtained is 96.5%, 91.4%, 99%, 98%, 91.3% and 94.5% respectively.

`Current` **Predicting and assessing equine embryo developmental competency by time-lapse image analysis using ML**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _ co-author: Dr. Pouya Dini_

: > This is an ongoing project for developing prediction models in vitro fertilization for optimal clinical use and optimal counseling on chances of a pregnancy with IVF. Currently, a dynamic machine learning model "Adaboost” is developed using data collected from 131 different patients. Next phase is implementing deep learning and computer vision to predict blastocyst viability using time-lapse images of embryos.
