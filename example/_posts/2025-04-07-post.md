# Building the Ultimate Research Paper Summarizer Agent

Writing a review paper sounded simple at first. Read a bunch of papers, extract key findings, summarize, and synthesize.

Right?

**Wrong.**

What I thought would be a straightforward academic task quickly became a time-consuming slog. Manually finding the right papers, understanding their content, and organizing them into a cohesive review was far harder than expected. It felt like I was reinventing the wheel every time I sat down to write.

That’s when I had an idea:

> **What if I built a tool that could do this grunt work for me?**

- 🔍 **Find** relevant papers based on search query 
- 🧹 **Filter** them using inclusion criteria  
- 📖 **Read and summarize** each one into a structured format  
- 🧾 Eventually help generate the scaffolding of a review paper

## The Vision: A Researcher's Dream Agent

I imagine the ultimate summarizer agent would work like this:

### 🔹 Input:
- A general **research topic** (e.g. "gene regulatory networks in synthetic biology")
- Optional filters like **date**, **species**, or **data type**
- A preferred **output format** (CSV, table, markdown, etc.)

### 🔹 Output:
- A **summary table** of key metadata from each paper
- Optional **Highlighted findings** or quotes
- Possibly even **draft review sections**, organized by themes
- Talking with the body of **papers**

## Phase 1: Systematic review Agent Using LangChain + OpenAI

To start, I tackled the hardest piece, and the most useful-one for me at least: **screening papers** and **extracting relevant data** from full-length PDF papers.

### 🛠 Tools Used:

- `LangChain`: to orchestrate chains and agents  
- `OpenAI GPT-4`: to extract structured insights  
- `PyPDFLoader`: to parse PDFs into readable chunks  
- `FAISS`: for document embedding and retrieval

### Key Features
- 🔍 Retrieve papers directly from PubMed Central  
- 🧹 Screen abstracts with GPT-4o against your custom objectives  
- 📊 Extract structured metadata (species, algorithms, results, etc.)  
- 🧾 Export clean JSON/CSV summaries for analysis

## 🚀 Example Run

```bash
research_agent analyze \
  --task meta \
  --objective "AI for diagnosing UTIs in dogs" \
  --filter-papers True \
  --max-results 50 \
  --output-dir ./output
